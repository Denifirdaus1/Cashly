# Setup Instructions for Cashly App

## Current Status

✅ **App Build Fixed**: The application now builds and runs successfully without Google Services configuration.

⚠️ **Google Drive Integration**: Currently disabled until proper setup is completed.

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Complete Google Drive Setup (Optional but Recommended)

To enable the auto-backup feature to Google Drive, you need to:

1. **Follow the detailed guide**: Read `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions
2. **Get SHA-1 fingerprint**: Run `get_sha1.bat` to get your app's fingerprint
3. **Setup Google Console**: Create OAuth credentials and download `google-services.json`
4. **Update configuration**: Add your Web Client ID to the code
5. **Re-enable Google Services**: Uncomment the plugins in build.gradle files

### 2. Current App Functionality

Even without Google Drive setup, the app provides:
- ✅ Full transaction management (add, edit, delete)
- ✅ Local data storage
- ✅ Reports and analytics
- ✅ All core features
- ❌ Auto-backup to Google Drive (disabled)
- ❌ Cloud sync (disabled)

### 3. Quick Start (Without Google Drive)

If you want to use the app immediately without Google Drive:

1. The app will show a Google Drive setup screen on first launch
2. You can skip this setup and use the app locally
3. All your data will be stored on your device
4. You can enable Google Drive backup later

### 4. Enable Google Drive Later

To enable Google Drive backup after initial setup:

1. Complete the Google Console setup (see `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
2. Add `google-services.json` to `android/app/`
3. Update the Web Client ID in `lib/services/google_drive_service.dart`
4. Uncomment Google Services plugins in:
   - `android/build.gradle.kts`
   - `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
5. Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run`

## Files Modified for Temporary Fix

- `android/build.gradle.kts`: Google Services plugin commented out
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts`: Google Services plugin commented out
- `lib/services/google_drive_service.dart`: Added setup validation
- `lib/features/setup/google_drive_setup_screen.dart`: Improved error messages

## Next Steps

1. **Test the app**: The app should now run successfully on your device
2. **Explore features**: Try adding transactions, viewing reports
3. **Setup Google Drive**: Follow the guide when you're ready for cloud backup
4. **Enjoy the app**: All core functionality is available immediately

**Note**: The Google Drive backup feature is a premium addition. The core app functionality works perfectly without it.
